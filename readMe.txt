This program runs in the JES environment. JES is a development environment for Python - an
IDE used mostly for manipulating media

The version of JES I used for this program is JES 4.3 (for Mac) and can be downloaded from
the following link: https://code.google.com/p/mediacomp-jes/downloads/list

In this short project I manipulated the picture "input_Eagle.jpg" to create the collage
"output_Collage.jpg"

As is, the program will run by direct execution if loaded in JES. However, the argument to
the createCollage function (the filepath) in the bottom of the script has to be changed to 
the location of 'input_Eagle.jpg'. For the purposes of this project, the program will
work only with pictures of the same dimensions as "input_Eagle.jpg"
